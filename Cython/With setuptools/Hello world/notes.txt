To build, run: python setup.py build_ext --inplace  
Then simply start a Python session and do from hello import say_hello_to and
use the imported function as you see fit.

One caveat: the default action when running python setup.py install is to 
create a zipped egg file which will not work with cimport for pxd files when 
you try to use them from a dependent package. To prevent this, include zip_safe=False in the arguments to setup().
